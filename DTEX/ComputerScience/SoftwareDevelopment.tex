		\maketitle			
		\section{Agile}
		 The values:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
			\item Working software over comprehensive documentation
			\item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
			\item Responding to change over following a plan 
		\end{itemize}
		The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
			\item Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
			\item Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
			\item Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
			\item Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
			\item Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
			\item Working software is the primary measure of progress
			\item Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
			\item Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
			\item Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
			\item Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
			\item Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
		\end{itemize}

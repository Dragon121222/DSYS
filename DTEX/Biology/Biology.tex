\section{Introduction} 
Biology is the study of organisms. 
An organism is a physical object which is the manifestation of a design encoded in itself or other organisms. This includes everything from viruses to  humans and leaves room for things which may not exist on the earth should we ever find those things. 
\section{Organization}
In biology organisms are classified using a taxonomic system. 
\begin{itemize}
\item domain
\item kingdom
\item phylum 
\item class
\item order
\item family
\item genus
\item species
\end{itemize}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)#Modern_system_of_classification}{Reference} \\ \\
However, it's not this simple as there are more branches needed to describe all of life that just this organizational structure, that's why we have a concepts of  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade}{Clade}.  \\
The highest level, Domain consists of three categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Archaea (Single Celled)
	\item Bacteria (Single Celled)
	\item Eukarya (Multi-celled)
\end{itemize}
